**Indepth-cli** is the interface of an application whose goal is to fix defects in applications developed with the Java language (Indepth automates java code refactoring and remediation).

Indepth-cli analyzes your java source code on your workstation and automatically discovers bad development practices or defects, bugs often referenced by the Sonarqube solution. 
It also automatically applies patches to the source code.

Be careful because although Indepth-cli is very carefully tested, the application can sometimes introduce bugs. 
It is therefore essential that you run your automatic or manual tests after modifying your application to verify that Indepth-cli has not introduced any bugs.

The Indepth-cli app is free to use for open source projects.
